            I give her all my love\nThat´s all I do\nAnd if you saw my love\nYou´d love her too\nI love her\nShe gives me everything\nAnd tenderly\nThe kiss my lover brings\nShe brings to me\nAnd I love her\nA love like ours\nCould never die\nAs long as I\nHave you near me\nBright are the stars that shine\nDark is the sky\nI know this love of mine\nWill never die\nAnd I love her\nBright are the stars that shine\nDark is the sky\nI know this love of mine\nWill never die\nAnd I love her

            Yesterday,\nAll my troubles seemed so far away,\nNow it looks as though they´re here to stay \nOh I believe in yesterday \n \nSuddenly, \nI´m not half the man I used to be \nThere´s a shadow hanging over me \nOh yesterday came suddenly \nWhy she had to go \nI don´t know, she wouldn´t say \nI said something wrong \nnow I long for yesterday \n\nYesterday, \nLove was such an easy game to play \nNow I need a place to hide away \nOh I believe in yesterday \n\nWhy she had to go \nI don´t know, she wouldn´t say \nI said something wrong \nnow I long for yesterday \n\nYesterday, \nLove was such an easy game to play \nNow I need a place to hide away \nOh I believe in yesterday
